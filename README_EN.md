# QuadraticCalc
## QuadraticCalc - A simple program for solving quadratic equations with a convenient graphical UI.

- The UI is based on an Api (https://github.com/quqveik1/TESTWIN32_GRAPHICAPP), and the Api itself is based on WIN32 GDI.

- The project includes a unit testing system to verify the solving mechanism.

- Detailed documentation is included in the download, providing further information on how the application works.

If you decide to build the application yourself, it is ESSENTIAL to download all the files from the Api (https://github.com/quqveik1/TESTWIN32_GRAPHICAPP) and link the Api folder to the application in the linker.
